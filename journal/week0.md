# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework

### Installing AWS CLI

I already had the AWS CLI installed on my local environment where I got the documentation from the [AWS Install Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
I Downloaded and run the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit) as provided in the guide and then setup my AWS environment.

### Create a budget
I created a $10 budget as that's all I am able to spare for the month for this particular bootcamp.

### Create a billing alarm
I also created a billing alarm just to show that there are different ways of tracking my spend and I made a $10 one as well.
