# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework

### Installing AWS CLI

I already had the AWS CLI installed on my local environment where I got the documentation from the [AWS Install Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
I Downloaded and run the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit) as provided in the guide and then setup my AWS environment.

### Create a budget
I created a $10 budget as that's all I am able to spare for the month for this particular bootcamp.

I also created a billing alarm just to show that there are different ways of tracking my spend and I made a $10 one as well.

## Homework Challenges

### Using EventBridge to hookup Health Dashboard to SNS to send notifications

As an added homework challenge I used EventBridge to hookup the health Dashboard which would then send me a notification whenever there is a health event on my primary location. 
I used the [AWS CloudWatch Events Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html) to create an EventrBridge rule and the used SNS as the medium to which I would receive the notifications.

I then had to create an SNS topic and subscribe in order to receice any notifications whenever there is any changes to the dashboard.
