### Installing AWS CLI

I already had the AWS CLI installed on my local environment where I got the documentation from the [AWS Install Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
I Downloaded and run the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit) as provided in the guide and then setup my AWS environment.
